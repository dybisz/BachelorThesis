\section{Production Model}
{\bf Waterfall} model is a model which was developed for software development; that is to create software. It is called as such because the model develops systematically from one phase to other in a downward fashion, like a waterfall.

To create Graphical User Interface, we will use JavaFx technology. It is a set of graphics and media packages that enables developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy rich client applications that operate consistently across diverse platforms. Written as a Java API, JavaFX application code can reference APIs from any Java library. For example, JavaFX applications can use Java API libraries to access native system capabilities and connect to server-based middleware applications \cite{javafx_description}. Since GUI will be simple and straight forward, this technology will provide cross-platform character of the application and help us develop it in no time. Only basic user interface elements such as buttons, text fields, label etc will be used, hence we do not demand any sophisticated API.

\subsection{Hamming Distance} \label{sec:hamming}

%\begin{definition}
Hamming distance $H_d$ between two string of the same length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols differ.
%\end{definition}

%\begin{example} 
Let $w = John$ and $v = Jhon$. Notice that the symbols at positions two and three differ. Thus the Hamming distance between these two strings is $H_d(w,v) = 2$.
%\end{example}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Clustering} \label{sec::cluster}

Clustering is a method of segregating elements of a given data set into groups. Elements similar to each other should fall into one group while dissimilar elements are supposed to be separated.

The problem arises when no prior information about the structure of the data is given. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{K-Means}

The well known k-means algorithm is employed for clustering. Let's assume that a~data set $X$ of size $n$ is going to be partitioned into $k$ number of clusters and each element $x_{j}\in X$ is assigned a~cluster. In order to do that, we find cluster centers $\mu_{i}, i=1,\ldots,k$ that minimize the distance from the elements from data set. Formally k-means solves the following optimization problem:
%\begin{equation}
%  $\argmin_{C}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{x\in C_{i}} d(x,\mu_{i})$
%\end{equation}
where $C_{i}$ is the set of elements that correspond to $i$-th cluster and $d(x,\mu_{i})$ is a~chosen distance measure between element $x$ and the cluster center $\mu_{i}$. At the first stage of the algorithm k centers $\mu_{i}$ are selected. Then each element is assigned to the closest cluster. The centers are updated with the mean of all points belonging to the corresponding cluster
\begin{equation}
  \mu_{i} = \frac{1}{|C_{i}|} \sum_{x\in C_{i}} x
\end{equation}

This process is repeated until convergence. It is worth mentioning that k-means might not find the best possible 
configuration.

\subsection{Automaton} \label{sec:autom}
%\begin{definition}
Automaton is a system of five fields:
\begin{center}
	$A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$
\end{center}

where \\
$Q$ - finite set of states. \\
$\Sigma$ - Finite input alphabet. \\
$\delta$ - transition function. $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ \\
$q_0$ - the initial state. $q_0 \in Q$ \\
$F$ - Set of accepting states. $F \subseteq Q$ \\
%\end{definition}

Table~\ref{fig:ttable_std} shows transition table for an example of an automaton.

The binary representation of automaton might perhaps provide more adequate solution for a computer. Thus a new transition function is defined, $\delta^{'}: Q \times \Sigma \times Q \rightarrow \{0,1\}$. It simply provides an answer whether there exists a transition between two states for a given symbol. For example, by looking at figure~\ref{fig:ttable_std} we can define value for $\delta^{'}(q^-,a,q^0) = 1$, since there exists a transition from $q^-$ to $q^0$ through symbol $a$. The entire automaton is presented in figure~\ref{fig:ttable_bin}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that to preserve determinism, there must exist exactly one transition from any state for a given symbol. In other words in each transition table for $\delta^{'}$ a single row must be a sequence of $0s$ and a single digit $1$.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Decoding} \label{sec:auto_dec}

Let us denote the number of states by $n = |Q|$, and number of symbols in alphabet by $r = |\Sigma|$. Further, we shall enumerate all states 	$Q = \{q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n\}$, and all the symbols in the alphabet 	$\Sigma = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_r\}$. We will also define the size of automaton $s(A) = n*r$.

We now turn to the binary approach of transition function $\delta^{'}$ described in the figure~\ref{fig:ttable_bin}. Notice that each table for symbol $x_l$ for $l = 1,2, \dots, r$ has exactly $n$ rows. Furthermore, we can easily decode each $row_{x_l, i}$ into a natural number. Let $j$ be the index of occurrence of digit $1$ in the $row_{x_l, i}$. The natural number $j$ will then be a decoding of $row_{x_l, i}$. Decoding of a single table will be a vector of $n$ natural numbers. Notice that the first element of such vector will correspond to the transition of initial state. Now the last objective of representing the automaton is to combine all vectors, each corresponding to transition table for symbol $x_{l}$. We simply append all vectors in order of the symbols' enumeration. The entire proceeder is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:encoding}. Firstly, in figures~\ref{fig:encoding_a} and~\ref{fig:encoding_b} we see decoding of transition tables for symbols $a$ and $b$ respectively. Finally the figure~\ref{fig:encoding_both} shows entire decoding of automaton $A$. We will call such decoding a direct or natural decoding of automaton with binary transition function.

\caption{Natural decoding of Automaton A}

\end{figure}

Natural decoding of an automaton with $n$ states and $r$ symbols in the alphabet will be a vector of size $n*r$. First element of each sub vector will indicate the transition for initial symbol. The retrieval of elements corresponding to transitions of specific symbols is omitted due to its triviality.

Formally, each element of the decoding vector is a natural number greater than 0. Summarizing, the elements of each dimension, take values from the discrete set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$.

It is worth mentioning, that in such decoding the information about accepting states is lost. This shall be of no concern, since the problem of this study takes no interest in actually accepted words. This discussion will resume in the following section.

\section{Algorithms} \label{section:Algorithms}

%---- JC ----%
\subsection{Particle Swarm Optimization}
In the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), originated by Eberhart and Kennedy in~\cite{pso_origin}, we look for optimal solution of the problem in the solution space. 

Each solution is called a particle and it consists of the following fields. First of all, the particle stores $fitness$ value which is evaluated by the fitness function, representing the quality of the solution and the best fitness value computed so far. It also stores the position $X_p$ and velocity vector $V_p$ which lets the particle travel through the solution space. Lastly two additional positions called $pbest_p$ and $lbest_p$ are stored. The position in which the particle $p$ reached its best fitness value so far is called $pbest_p$. However, the $lbest_p$ is the position of the best fitness value obtained so far by any other particle in the neighbourhood of particle $p$. The concept of neighbourhood is defined later in this section.

PSO is initialized with random group of particles. It then searches for the optimal solution by updating generations.
In each iteration $t$, the particles are updated by calculating new fitness and velocity which in turn is applied to update new position of the particle. $X_p(t)$ will denote the position of particle $p$ at time $t$, i.e. the $t$-th iteration. Similarly, the velocity vector is denoted by $V_p(t)$.

The PSO will take as input number of states $n$ and number of symbols in alphabet $r$.

Firstly, the general flow of the PSO algorithm is given, then each module is discussed and defined in details.

\begin{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item For the input $n$ and $r$, initialize the group of particles.

	\item For each particle: \label{itm:pso_iter}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Calculate the fitness value, using the fitness function.
		\item Compare the fitness to its best obtained so far, the better value is stored together with $pbest_p$	
		
		\item Update velocity and position.	
		
		\item Find neighbourhood and update $lbest_p$ position.
	\end{enumerate}		
	

	
	\item Repeat~\ref{itm:pso_iter}. until an ending criterion is met.

	\item Output the best solution	
	
\end{enumerate}

\end{center}

We now concentrate on describing in details each step of the PSO algorithm. The following part of this section is devoted to illustrating problems associated with the objective of this study and more importantly, methods of solving these problems.


%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Representing the solution}
As an input, the PSO algorithm takes number of states $n$ and number of symbols in the alphabet $r$.
Solution that the PSO is trying to find is an automaton. Let us recall that automaton is a system: $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$. In a single PSO instance we assume that a set of states $Q$ and alphabet $\Sigma$ is invariant. Through the nature of our problem we can conclude that distinguishing the set $F$ of accepting states is not necessary. Namely, the tool given to us (DFA) described in section~\ref{sub:definition} only answers whether any arbitrary two words are in the relation induced by the language. That information suffices in the process of recreating that DFA. Thus, we only need to represent the transition function and initial state.

The position of our particles will be represented by the natural decoding vector of size $n*r$ of an automaton described in section~\ref{sec:auto_dec} with more freedom allowed. Namely, all of the dimensions of the position will take real values in the interval $[1, n]$. Whenever we need to encode the automaton back, we simply round up the values, taking the closest integer value. The real number $3.4$ becomes $3$ and $3.5$ becomes 4.

As we may learn further in the article, the method of updating the particle will make a good use of continuous interval. On the other hand, the method of rounding up real numbers, might be vulnerable to error.



%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Initialization}
In order to initialize the PSO algorithm, we must first decide on the size of the swarm (i.e. the number of particles). The swarm will be a static group, meaning that the size will not change through out the computations of a single PSO instance. The size should then be a constant value, in terms of an automaton given at the time. We propose that the size of the swarm should be proportional to the size of the automaton. To be precise, the swarm size is equal to the size of the automaton times a constant $c_P$ called a $population$ factor.

Further, we must initialize particle's position. Let us recall that the dimension of the search space is defined by the size of an automaton, namely $(n*r)$, where $n$ is the number of states and $r$ is the number of symbols in the alphabet. Each dimension taking a real value in the range $[1, n]$. Thus, we proceed to generate random position in the given range.

The initial velocities will be generated from the range $[-n,n]$. It is also crucial to define a maximum change in position that one particle can take during a single iteration. For this purpose the constant $v_{max}$ is defined that prevents the particle from travelling in any dimension further than $v_{max}$ units. The maximum change is defined by the equation 

\begin{equation}
	v_{max} = (\frac{n}{2})c_{v}
\end{equation}
where $c_{v}$ is a constant $speed$ factor and $v_{max} \leq n$.

In all cases uniform distribution is used for random number generation.

\subsubsection{Fitness Function}\label{sec:fitness}
It describes how well a particle (in our case an automaton) reflects the goal. Since all we know about our target DFA (accepting language $L$) is a tool described in subsection \ref{sub:definition}, we decided to base our fitness function on knowledge about relation $R_{L}$. 

Measure is fairly simple: for a given set of pairs of words, we check how many of them are correctly classified to equivalence class (using $R_{L} relation$) and divide this amount by number of all pairs. We will use example to illustrate the process.

%\begin{example}\label{ex:fitness}


Let us assume that we have following set of pairs
\[
S_{test} = \{(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4), (x_5, y_5)\} \subset \Sigma^{*}\times\Sigma^{*} 
\]
and an automaton $A_p$ (encoded back from a particle $p$).
Let us also recall automaton $T$, whose behaviour has been described in definition \ref{def:T} and define $\# = \{ x : x \in \{1 ,0 \}\}$  Having all of this we can construct simple table to illustrate the idea:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ m{4.5em}  m{3em}  m{3em}  m{3em} }
                 & $T$ & $A_p$ & $\#$ \\  
 $x_1 R_{L} y_1$ & 1 & 0 & 0 \\   
 $x_1 R_{L} y_1$ & 0 & 0 & 1 \\   
 $x_1 R_{L} y_1$ & 0 & 0 & 1 \\   
 $x_1 R_{L} y_1$ & 1 & 1 & 1 \\   
 $x_1 R_{L} y_1$ & 0 & 0 & 0 \\   
\end{tabular}
\caption{Computing the error of an automaton $A_p$}
\label{fig:fitness_table}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%\end{example}

Entries of figure \ref{fig:fitness_table} are calculate as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check computation of automaton $T$ for each pair of words from set $S_{test}$
\item If computations end in the same state for both words, put 1 in column $T$ and row corresponding to that pair.
\item Otherwise put 0
\item Repeat steps 1., 2. and 3. for automaton $A_p$ and write results in column $A_p$
\item If in row for (columns $T$ and $A_p$), we have the same digits (i.e. 1 1 or 0 0 ), put 1 in the last column ($\#$)
\item Otherwise put 0
\end{enumerate}

At this point we can define fitness function $F$, in terms of presented notation:
\[
	F = \frac{|\{x \in \# : x = 1 \}|}{|\#|}
\]



Concerning given example, $F = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6$. One needs to note that this function is never bigger than 1, nor less than 0. Closer $F$ gets to one, better the automaton approximation.

\subsubsection{Updating the particle}


% Naive approach

%The naive approach of updating the particles' positions was proposed in the original PSO %algorithm~\cite{pso_origin}.

%\begin{equation}
%		V_p(t+1) = V_p(t) + c_1 * \mu_1 *(pbest_p - X_p(t)) + c_2 * \mu_2 *(lbest_p - X_p(t))
%	\end{equation}
%
%	\begin{equation}
%		X_p(t+1) = X_p(t) + V_p(t)
%	\end{equation}
%	where:\\
%	$c_1, c_2$ are the constant learning factors.\\
%	$\mu_1, \mu_2$ are random numbers in the range [0,1]. {\color{red} TODO What %distribution function - uniform ?} \\



The following method of updating the particles has its origins in the Standard Particle Swarm Optimization version 2011 presented in~\cite{pso_11}

Let $G_p(t)$ be the centre of gravity of the three points:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Current position. \\
	$X_p(t)$
	
	\item Point a bit beyond $pbest_p$. \\
	$Y_{p1}(t) = c*(pbest_p-X_p(t))$
	
	\item Point a bit beyond $lbest_p$. \\
	$Y_{p2}(t) = c*(lbest_p-X_p(t))$
			
\end{enumerate}

The constant $c = \frac{1}{2} + ln(2)$ called a learning factor, together with the inertia parameter that weights the particle's velocity $\omega = \frac{1}{2 * ln(2)}$ used in further equations, was proposed by Clerc in~\cite{pso_anal}.

Formally $G_p(t)$ it is defined by the following formula 
\begin{equation}
	G_p(t) = \frac{X_p(t) + Y_{p1}(t) + Y_{p2}(t)} {3}
\end{equation}

We now define a random point $X^{'}_p$ in the hypersphere
\begin{center}
	$\mathcal{H}_p(G_p, d(G_p, X_p))$ 
\end{center}
of centre $G_p$ and of radius $d(G_p, X_p)$ where the function $d$ is an euclidean distance between two points. The time $t$ has been omitted for simplicity.

The velocity update is computed by
\begin{equation}
	V_p(t+1) = \omega * V_p(t) + X^{'}_p(t) - X_p(t)
\end{equation}
Thus the position is updated by the equation

\begin{equation}
	X_p(t+1) = \omega * V_p(t) + X^{'}_p(t)
\end{equation}

% Exploitation vs Exploration

%This method of updating the particles grants adequate definitions for $exploitation$ and $exploration$. Namely the exploitation occurs when $X_p(t+1)$ is inside atleast one hypersphere $\mathcal{H}_q$, otherwise we recognize exploration.


% Interval confinement
It may happen that the particle might leave the search space, in means that the particle lies outside the acceptable interval. If that happens we generally try to lead the particle back to its right course. For each dimension $x_{d} \in X_p$ that lies  outside the acceptable interval we apply the following:

  \[
	x_{d} \notin [x_{min}, x_{max}] \Rightarrow \left \{
                \begin{array}{ll}
                  v_{d} = 0 \\
                  x_d < x_{min} \Rightarrow x_d = x_{min} \\
                  x_d > x_{max} \Rightarrow x_d = x_{max}
                \end{array}
              \right.
  \]

This means that the corresponding dimension of velocity vector $v_d \in V_p$ is zeroed and the position is bound to the edge of the interval.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Neighbourhood}
The neighbourhood system is defined by grouping the swarm into clusters. Cluster analysis methods can estimate the number of clusters $k$ that a data set should be grouped with. An algorithm for cluster evaluation used in this work is called mcclain-rao defined in~\cite{mc_rao}. Having the knowledge of data distortion, the data is then clustered into $k$ clusters, where each cluster represents a single neighbourhood. K-means algorithm is used to compute the clustering. The following formulates the algorithm for neighbourhood update.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Evaluate number of clusters in the swarm using the mcclian-rao index. Denote that number by $k$.
	\item Group the swarm into $k$ clusters using k-means algorithm.
	\item Each cluster represents a single neighbourhood.
\end{enumerate}


%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Ending criteria}
The computation finishes after $t_{max}$ iterations or after finding a satisfactory solution which is bounded by $F_{max} \in [0,1]$, where value 1 corresponds to trying to find the automaton exactly as good as $T$ defined in definition~\ref{def:T}.

\textcolor{red}{Remark:} What should be stress out is that class diagrams presented in this section may not cover all methods needed to implement full functionality. For sure presented methods are neccessary, but not always sufficient. Although we were trying to be as precise as we can, they constitutes only a sketch of solution.

% WORD PROCESSING CLASS DIAGRAM
%
\newpage
\subsection{Words Processing}
To perform words generation/processing we will use classes presented on figure \ref{fig:words_processing_class}.

Since it happens to be largest and most important of all four, let us first focus on \texttt{WordsGenerator} class. Its main purpose is to create words using rules described in section \ref{section:Algorithms}. There are in fact two type of conditions to cover:
\begin{itemize}
\item parametrical, where the class checks global parameters related to word processing
\item hamming condition, generated word of some length, let us say $n$, must have hamming distance between all (up to now) generated words of length $n$ smaller than some defined constant (see \ref{section:Algorithms} for reference)
\end{itemize}

Check of the first one is done via \texttt{\_checkGlobalConsitions()} and latter one is covered by \texttt{\_hammingCondition()}. As one can easily see, \texttt{\_hammingDistance()} method is just an auxiliary procedure for work related to checking hamming condition. Although method \texttt{\_generateRandomWordOverAlphabet} speaks for itself, \texttt{\_generateRandomWordStartinWith} needs some explanation. As we are forced to firstly produce words starting with different symbols of alphabet (again section \ref{section:Algorithms}), this method provides a way to create such a word with hamming condition checked. User specifies only starting symbol and length of the word and procedure returns random word starting with particular symbol and of specified length. There are only two public methods: constructor, which forces user to specify alphabet and \texttt{getPairs()}. The last one's ability is to gather all generated words and combine them into pairs. Such approach is forced by PSO's fitness function. 

Despites its vague name, \texttt{BagOfWords} is class which preserves set of words in form of an unordered map, where keys are lengths and entries are vectors of words of specified length. It enables easy access to words of some particular length. We took such approach because most comparisions in the \texttt{WordsGenerator} class is done by checking hamming condition, which concerns words of the same length. What is more, section \ref{section:Algorithms} obliged us to create 3 disjunctive sets of words: $\Omega_S$, $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_L$ and using this class we can fulfil this need, preserving all desired functionality. When needed one can always gather all words as a vector using \texttt{getAllWords()} method.

Last two classes were created to make code more transparent. \texttt{PairOfWords} simply wraps two words together and \texttt{Word} class supplies user with short set of methods operating on vector of integers (which simulates a word). As mentioned they are more needed because their names than actual functionalites.

% TRANSITION TABLE CLASS DIAGRAM
%
\newpage
\subsection{Transition Table}
Classes used to model behaviour of transition table are presented on figure \ref{fig:trans_table_class}. 

\textcolor{red}{Remark:} It is worth to notice that in all consecutive classes, entries of transition tables stays as a vector of integers. Each table, beginning with \texttt{StandardTransitionTable}, provides its own way to read values from the vector either via overloading \texttt{operator ()} or by implementing methods.

As one can see, starting from most general \texttt{TransitionTable} and going up on chains of inheritance classes broad they abilities. Base class provides only methods for loading automaton from file specified via \texttt{url} string. It is able to either load it symbol by symbol ( \texttt{\_loadOneSymbol()} ) or fill up all entries at once - \texttt{\_loadEntries()}. Entries at this level can not be interpreted using any transition table type - it is just raw data.

Next, one can create \texttt{StandardTransitionTable}, which interprets \texttt{\_entries} as a table where columns represents symbols and rows are states. Classes, which will inherit from this one are provided with method \texttt{\_accessTransitionTable()} and for public usage \texttt{operator ()} has been overloaded. Both approaches force to pass symbol and state and as a results guarantee state. 

Thrid  is \texttt{PerSymbolTransitionTable}, which is more suited for computer interpretation of automaton. It assumes that each symbol has its own table. Each table's column and rows represents consecutive states and entries takes values equal to either $0$ or $1$. Such a values describe situation when "two states are not connected" and "there is connection between states", repsectively. Simmiraly to \texttt{StandardTransitionTable}, there are two ways to acces table. Public access is provided by overloaded \texttt{operator ()} and protected access is anabled via \texttt{\_isTransition()} method. Both needs two states and symbol to determine whether there is connection or not, hence return value is of boolean type.

Last but not least, we have \texttt{CodedTransitionTable} class. First observable difference appears in constructors - this class enables to initialize transition table either via loading and coding automaton from file or accepting coded automaton and decoding it to achieve transition table. Such approach has been forced by Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. TO be a little bit more precise: paticles are represented by coded deterministic finite automata and need to be updated, which causes automata to change. In such a case we just create new automaton from updated particle's coded DFA table. \texttt{\_getCodedTransitionTable}, as name says, returns coded table, which then can be used as a position of particle within PSO space. All other methods concerns either coding or decoding procedures and are described more in section \ref{section:Algorithms}.

Classes necessary to model and develop GUI are presented on figure \ref{fig:gui_classes}. On the other hand, look that we are trying to achieve is roughly sketch on figure \ref{fig:gui_look}.

As one could image, because of simplicity of the interface, there is nothing fancy in class diagram. \texttt{MainWindow} handles loading .fxml file and starting the application. On the oder hand, class \texttt{MainWindowControls} is in charge of events processing. It handles any event occurred regarding user interface objects and performs appropriate actions. Since main functionality of this part of the application is to set up global configurations, when some value within an user interface object will change, so will corresponding entry in configuration file. One can easily load and save configurations files, as well as changing directory of input and output files. Presented figure \ref{fig:gui_look}, depicting design of the application, is definitely not the final one and in future it might contain e.g. text labels with more informations about features or some loading bars. Main look of the program should be defined in .fxml, which will not be presented in this paper due to its irrelevancy and numerous way of implementations.
